        Assassin's Creed is a franchise centered on an action-adventure video game series developed by Ubisoft. It depicts a centuries-old struggle pitting the Assassins, who fight for peace and free will, against the Templars, who believe peace comes through control of humanity. The series features historical fiction mixed with real-world historical events and figures. The series took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol,[1] while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series.[2]

        The franchise began in 2007 with the release of Assassin's Creed. The main video game series consists of ten entries, developed by Ubisoft Montreal (single-player) and Ubisoft Annecy (multiplayer), released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Microsoft Windows, and OS X platforms. Many spin-off games have been made for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, iOS, HP webOS, Android, Nokia Symbian and Windows Phone platforms. The handheld versions are developed by Gameloft and Gryptonite Studios, with additional development by Ubisoft Montreal.
        
        The series has been well received by critics, and has sold over 100 million copies as of September 2016, becoming Ubisoft's best selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time.
        
        The video game series has been expanded into a film, comics and novels; all of which take place within the same continuity as the main video games series.
